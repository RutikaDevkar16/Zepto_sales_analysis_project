 Zepto Sales Analysis Dashboard 
Exploring Power BI and sharing my Zepto Sales Analysis Dashboard 📊

This dashboard focuses on understanding sales performance, pricing impact, and city-wise trends using interactive visuals.
Through this project, I worked on:
✅ Analyzing revenue, profit, and orders using KPI cards
✅ Identifying top-performing categories and products
✅ Comparing original vs discounted prices to understand pricing impact
✅ Evaluating city-wise revenue performance
✅ Using slicers and visuals to make insights easy to explore

This project helped me understand that a dashboard is not just about visuals, but about:
✨ Structuring data properly
✨ Connecting business questions with insights
✨ Presenting information that supports better decision-making

Continuing to learn and improve my skills in Power BI and data analytics 🚀
